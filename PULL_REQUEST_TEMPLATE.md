<!-- this template should be used for TMIB pull requests; other pull requests should not use it -->

Want to help out with writing TMIB but don't have write access to the repo?
[Go here](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng.github.io/blob/tmib-<ISSUE NUMBER>/_posts/<ISSUE PUBLISH DATE>-tmib-<ISSUE NUMBER>.md), then click the pencil button. That'll open a pull request for the in-progress edition of TMIB.

These steps can be done immediately after opening the TMIB pull request:

- [ ] Fix the "Go here" link at the top of this pull request

- [ ] Update the issue number in the `title:` part

- [ ] Update the month in the `date:` part

- [ ] Update the month in the `summary:`

- [ ] Update the URL in the "last month" PR link

These steps need to be done as the month rolls along, though they should probably be proofread at the end:

- [ ] Write the "notable additions" list

- [ ] Write the "new contributors" list

- [ ] Find a new featured user

And, these should be done last thing:

- [ ] Update the PR count in the PR paragraph

- [ ] Create, and link in, next month's PR, so that the published edition links to the next one

- [ ] Write a few useful tidbits in the summary: part

And publish to third-party syndication services:
