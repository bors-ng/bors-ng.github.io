It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a bot for [making sure the repository doesn't break](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/making-sure-the-repository-doesnt-break.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-03-01..2018-03-31),
we landed 13 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is Ubuntu's [Mir display server](https://mir-server.io/), a replacement for the twenty-year-old and *incredibly* crufty X Window System that Linux has been using. The goals of the whole effort can be summarized as:

* Get a fluid UI like users are used to on other platforms (f'n'f).
* Run less code as root, and prevent apps from impersonating the shell (secure).
* Work in constrained environments, and on things like 4K screens (portable).
* Become a drop-in Wayland compositor for Desktop Environments to use (standard).
