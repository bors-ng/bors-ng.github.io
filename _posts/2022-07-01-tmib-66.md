It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng. [Bors will batch any approved PR's, merges them with master in a staging branch where the CI builds and tests the result. After a successful test, the actual master gets fast-forwarded to that point.](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/blob/master/docs/contributors/environment.rst)

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2022-06-01..2022-06-30),
we landed 3 PRs in the bors-ng repository.
