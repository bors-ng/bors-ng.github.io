It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a GitHub app to prevent [merge skew](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206976135-Pre-Tested-Commit-No-broken-code-in-your-version-control-Ever-).
[Bors prevents merge skew because it tests the results of the merge and not the HEAD of the PR branch.](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/22499#issuecomment-376993981)
