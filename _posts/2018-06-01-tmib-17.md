It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a GitHub app to prevent [merge skew](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206976135-Pre-Tested-Commit-No-broken-code-in-your-version-control-Ever-).
[Bors prevents merge skew because it tests the results of the merge and not the HEAD of the PR branch.](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/22499#issuecomment-376993981)

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-05-01..2018-05-31),
we landed 5 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [crates.io],
the software running the Rust language projects's official library package hosting service.
Crates is one of those apps where the app is really simple, basically just a file service with a specialized metadata indexer,
and the tough part was getting everybody to use the same one,
instead of ending up with several competing solutions like Haskell, C, Go, and other legacy languages have.

They're also running both Node tests on their frontend code, and Rust tests on their backend code. [Here's how they're doing it in their Travis configuration.](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/blob/4d8706438733a8a0dab969d207b0725a1a3e95d5/.travis.yml#L52-L71)
