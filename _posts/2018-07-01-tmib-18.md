It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng.

> [bors modifies the usual github CI workflow in a subtle but important
way](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/commit/b5ffb75684d83e3faf578403327eb395e0f140b4):
>
> With regular github, the CI test (eg: travis-ci) needs to pass before
the Merge button goes green - but the PR might be against a stale
version of master, and the test *does not have to pass against
master+PR*.  There is a github option to enforce this too, but it puts
the work on the user and requires them to rebase against HEAD before
the merge button will go green.
>
> After the PR has been "approved" (*), bors rebases the PR and runs the
CI bot (travis) *again* against master+PR, and only merges if that
passes.  Iow, "approve-for-merge" is separated from "actually-merge".
>
> Subtle, but important :P
>
> See <https://graydon.livejournal.com/186550.html> for the blog version
of the above.
>
> (*) bors approval is indicated with a `bors r+` github comment.  See
<https://bors.tech/documentation/> for other bot commands.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is DDraceNetwork, a mod of the Teeworlds video game. Teeworlds is an online multiplayer 2D shooter/platformer, but there've been modded servers for other things since the game was released in 2007. DDraceNetwork currently run the largest group of servers for racing to see who can get through a map the quickest.

Their [custom server and client](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet) runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The original Teeworlds software didn't have automated tests, but they've been adding some when they've added new functionality. Their server also maintains compatibility with the original Teeworlds client.

There's a pre-bors [blog post from a project member about their server setup](https://hookrace.net/blog/ddnet-evolution-architecture-technology/).
