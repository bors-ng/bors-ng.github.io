It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng. [Bors is a Github bot that prevents merge skew / semantic merge conflicts by testing the exact integration of pull requests before merging them.](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/DynamicPPL/2PWyN/0.10.5).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2021-01-01..2021-01-31),
we landed 15 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
