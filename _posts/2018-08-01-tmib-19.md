### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [rust-num](https://github.com/rust-num/num), the numerics library for Rust.

This project holds maintainership over several "advanced numerics" libraries (Rust has basics fixed-length integer and floating point math, equal to C, built-in). Here's some of their libraries:

* [num-bigint](https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint): math with numbers bigger than 128 bits
* [num-complex](https://github.com/rust-num/num-complex): math with an imaginary component
* [num-integer](https://github.com/rust-num/num-integer): extensions for integers, including the built-in fixed-length integers and num-bigint
  * a trait (similar to interfaces and concepts in other languages) for integers, allowing generic code that supports any type of integer
  * additional integer functions like `nth_root`
* [num-iter](https://github.com/rust-num/num-iter): an enhanced version of `Range`
* [num-rational](https://github.com/rust-num/num-rational): a fraction library
* [num-traits](https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits): generic traits for all numbers
