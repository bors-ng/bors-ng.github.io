### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is Canonical [Multipass](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass). Multipass is a lightweight virtual machine orchestrator for Ubuntu, that can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. It is specifically for Ubuntu: it automatically keeps Ubuntu images up-to-date, it can act as a cloud-init server, and you can shell into your Ubuntu VM with a single command.
