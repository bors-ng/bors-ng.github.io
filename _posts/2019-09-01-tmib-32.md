### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Tock OS](https://www.tockos.org/), an embedded operating system for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. [Here's their GitHub page](https://github.com/tock/tock).

Tock [is designed](https://www.tockos.org/documentation/design) to provide high-granularity isolation without using lots of memory. While most operating systems do isolation by giving each process its own slice of memory, Tock additionally isolates kernel-level "capsules" using language-based isolation, providing greater security guarantees without additional memory fragmentation.
