### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Tock OS](https://www.tockos.org/), an embedded operating system for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. [Here's their GitHub page](https://github.com/tock/tock).

Tock [is designed](https://www.tockos.org/documentation/design) to provide high-granularity isolation without using lots of memory. While most operating systems do isolation by giving each process its own slice of memory, Tock isolates "capsules" at the language level, allowing allocations to be mixed freely in memory and reducing fragmentation.
