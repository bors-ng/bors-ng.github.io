It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a third-party bot that predates [GitHub Merge Queues] and does mostly the same thing.

[GitHub Merge Queues]: https://matklad.github.io/2023/06/18/GitHub-merge-queue.html

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2023-06-01..2023-06-30),
we landed 11 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!
