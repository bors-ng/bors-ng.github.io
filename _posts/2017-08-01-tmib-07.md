### Who's using bors?

This month's featured project is [BHIMA] version 2, the *basic hospital information management application*.

Technically speaking, it's a web-based database-centric business app. Hospital workers type in what's going on in the hospital, and they can use it to look up things like vacancies and medical history. Manager queries are also provided against the database, so that they can generate data about the hospital (traffic patterns, current stock, and spending habits, for example) and plan accordingly.

[BHIMA] is open source under the GPL, and it's run by [Interchurch Medical Assistance][IMA], a charity that gives aid in underdeveloped countries (see [IMA's page on CharityNavigator][IMA CharityNavigator] and [Forbes's "200 largest charities" description][IMA Forbes]). IMA distributes things like water filters, shelters for abuse victims, contraceptives, vaccines, and health infrastructure for local hospitals (BHIMA, for example).
