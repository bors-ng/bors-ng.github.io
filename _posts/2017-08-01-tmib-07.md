It's another monthly burst of news about bors,
the GitHub bot that prevents broken builds from landing in mainline.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-07-01..2017-07-31),
we landed ___ PRs in the bors-ng repository.

By the way, we've got a real domain name now! Goodbye to bors-ng.github.io and bors-app.herokuapp.com, and hello to bors.tech and app.bors.tech.

Bors-NG has also [adopted](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/134) the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
This has been a long time coming, and was blocked on getting a moderator mailing list set up to report unacceptable behavior.
That mailing list is now set up, and running on the new domain name as <community@bors.tech>.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured project is [BHIMA] version 2, the *basic hospital information management application*.

Technically speaking, it's a web-based database-centric business app.  Unlike other ERPs, BHIMA targets a low resource, multi-currency and multi-lingual environment.  Hospital workers input medical, financial, and pharmaceutical data via online forms, and they can use it to look up things like vacancies, the financial status of any patient, and their medical history. Manager queries are also provided against the database, so that they can generate data about the hospital (traffic patterns, current stock, and spending habits, for example) and plan accordingly.

[BHIMA] is open source under the GPL, and it's developed [Interchurch Medical Assistance World Health][IMA], a nonprofit focusing on health system strengthening in underdeveloped countries (see [IMA's page on CharityNavigator][IMA CharityNavigator] and [Forbes's "200 largest charities" description][IMA Forbes]). IMA's programs encompass distributing medical and nutritional supplies, advocacy and social justice initiatives, sexual health education, and capacity building for health infrastructure (BHIMA being one of several software initiatives in this field).
