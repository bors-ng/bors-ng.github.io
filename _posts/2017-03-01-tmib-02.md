It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
the bot that tests your code before it becomes the master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-02-01..2017-02-28),
I landed __ PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Notable Additions

- Added [`bors try`](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/81), a command to test a PR without approving it
- Ack comments immediately and let GitHub gating work by sending [GitHub status notifications](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/88)
- [Infer](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/102) the CI system that a repository uses based on the system's config file, without a bors.toml file.
- [Added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/105) the "[ci skip]" directive to temporary commits, so that CircleCI and other CI systems that support this convention do not attempt to build intermediate commits.
