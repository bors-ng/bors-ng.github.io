It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
because if your primary development branch has failing tests,
[you don't have a code problem; you have a process problem](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1026434505136132096.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-08-01..2018-08-31),
we landed 13 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.
If you find a mistake, [pull requests] or [issue reports] are appreciated!

### Who's using bors?

[CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) is a distributed relational database
that speaks the PostgreSQL client-server protocol as a drop-in replacement for existing apps.

It has a sharding and replication algorithm built-in,
which maintains high availability and consistency in many common failure scenarios.
A CockroachDB cluster will maintain consistency by going down if a majority of nodes can't reach each other
(it is a [CP distributed data store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)).
It supports, but doesn't require, you to define availability regions and replication rules.

Cockroach Labs runs a [self-hosted instance of bors-ng and TeamCity](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/wiki/Bors-merge-bot) called "craig" on Google Cloud.
They've been great help getting the self-host documentation and Docker Hub working well.
