It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
a GitHub bot that gives your project [Continuous Integration][tweet] instead of Continuous Failure.

### Who's using bors?

This month, we're featuring [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon), an extremely cool Rust library for "data parallelism." Basically, you can replace `iter()` calls with `par_iter()`, and then you can do stuff on the data structure using all of your cores instead of just one. Rayon uses its thread pool system, and general "rayon runtime", to keep things efficient without you really having to think about it, and Rust's type system makes sure you don't do anything badly-formed, so using Rayon is basically as easy as writing sequential code.
