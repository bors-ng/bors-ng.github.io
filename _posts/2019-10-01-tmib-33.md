It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a development workflow [you can be confident enough in](https://twitter.com/duckinator/status/1176922838844006400) to queue 3 PRs to be merged, walk away, and not intend to look at again for at least 3-4 hours.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2019-09-01..2019-09-30),
we landed 19 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!
