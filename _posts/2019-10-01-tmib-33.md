It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a development workflow [you can be confident enough in](https://twitter.com/duckinator/status/1176922838844006400) to queue 3 PRs to be merged, walk away, and not intend to look at again for at least 3-4 hours.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2019-09-01..2019-09-30),
we landed 19 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Ruby Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
Bundler is a project dependency manager:
it installs your project's dependencies (specified in the Gemfile) into a folder that only your project uses, so that if you have two different projects that require different versions of the same library, they can both work.
Bundler has become the *industry standard* that other language project managers, like Mix, NPM, Cargo, and Pkg.jl are modeled after.

Bundler has also been an early adopter of the bors family of tools.
They're one of the bors-ng users that migrated off of homu [over a year ago](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/7856ce7d6d491e596fbe9e0c62dc80d5a89a5fd2) after barosl stopped maintaining it, and added [a couple features](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aindirect) to bors-ng that they needed.
Though they're not using [that cool setup with the webhook router](https://bors.tech/writeup/2018/09/26/bundlerbot/) any more, they're still self-hosting bors-ng as `@bundlerbot`.

Got any suggestions for next month?
