It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
the bot that tests your code before it becomes the master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-03-01..2017-03-31),
I landed ___ PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Notable Additions

* [Refactored](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/111) into an umbrella app
* [Plugged](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/114) a timer leak, keeping the batcher at one-poll-per-hour
* [Made](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/117) the batcher supervisor clear the queue if the batcher crashes, preventing transient bad state from causing an infinite loop

### Who's using bors?

> We ([@nubisonline][], http://nub.is/) are using it in a couple of our larger projects.
>
> Our main use case is this: We have quite a large number of feature branches being worked on simultaneously, and a deployment procedure that takes rather long (~40 mins).
> We also have the policy that feature branches need to have the master merged into them before they can be merged back.
>
> This results in a project manager having several tabs of PRs open during the day, merging one that is tested and green, then merging the master into the next one, waiting, merging that one once it becomes green, etc (with each of these steps taking the ~40 minutes).
>
> With bors, we just mark all the ones that are green, and bors takes care of merging them in the right order and checking if merging master in it doesn't break things.
>
> In fact, this had gotten so annoying that I had 'build a queuing system for PRs' rather high on my to do list when I found bors :)
>
> One of the projects we're using it for is live here: https://privatelease.peugeot.nl/, https://privatelease.citroen.nl/, a car configure app for Peugeot/CitroÃ«n
