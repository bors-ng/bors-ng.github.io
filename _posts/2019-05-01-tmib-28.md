It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng. [Slightly less sophisticated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19695027) than what Uber does, but still usable for small-ish teams.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2019-04-01..2019-04-30),
we landed 12 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl), the default package manager for the Julia, a numerics-focused programming language.

* Julia is a multi-paradigm language with a REPL and and optimizing compiler, designed to allow entire systems to be written in one language (unlike, for example, NumPy, which uses Python and C).
* Pkg.jl — like Bundler, Cargo, Mix, or NuGet — is a system for automatically installing libraries to run applications, and allows multiple applications to have access to different sets of libraries by giving them separate "environments".
* Pkg.jl supports "federated" package repositories, meaning that one project can depend on libraries from multiple sources.
