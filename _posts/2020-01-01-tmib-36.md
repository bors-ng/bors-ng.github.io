### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [wasmer.io](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer), the Universal WebAssembly Runtime. Wasmer can be used as a library for executing WebAssembly bytecode in applications written in a variety of languages (Rust, C, C++, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, PostgreSQL Extensions, JavaScript, .NET, R, and Swift, currently), as well as a standalone interpreter.

They also provide a library package manager, the [`wapm`](https://wapm.io/), a toolchain for the `wat` WebAssembly Text format, and implementations of the "Emscripten" and "WASI" syscall interfaces.
