It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
a GitHub App that acts as the last-step in a code review workflow by taking human-approved pull requests and making sure they pass all the tests when merged against master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-10-01..2017-10-31),
we landed `___` PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.
If you find a mistake, [pull requests] or [issue reports] are appreciated!

### Notable Additions

* abeltensor [added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/302) a "nothing to see here" indicator to the front page and the repository list page
* notriddle [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/307) bad crash handling in cases when GitHub times out or is down
* kimsaehun [shortened](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/309) the commit ID at the bottom of the screen
* kimsaehum [made](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/314) bors-ng infer that you're using CodeShip based on the presence of appropriate config files in your repo
* GustavoCaso [removed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/316) a redundant notification when you logged in
* GustavoCaso [changed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/318) the command parser to match the name "bors" case-insensitively (so "Bors r+" is a valid way to approve a PR now)

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [pyvisa][], a Python library for the [Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA)][VISA], not to be confused with the credit card payment processor or the paperwork used to move between countries.

VISA is a standard hardware interface for [Testing and Measurement (T&M) devices][TM]. VISA defines high-level message-passing semantics, as well as protocols for tunneling over common physical connects (some are measurement-specific like GPIB, while others are generic like USB and TCP/IP). It also defines a C API for applications to talk to an implementation of the protocol.

The main [pyvisa][pyvisa-lib] library, as such, is a plugabble frontend with two official backends. One backend uses ctypes FFI, and other backend is a [pure Python implementation][pyvisa-py] of the VISA wire protocol (over USB, TCP/IP, and Serial, though more physical protocol support is in the works). You can also develop your own backend and pyvisa can dynamically load it.
