It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a GitHub App for automated testing
[by branching from master, and rerunning tests before the final merge, like you should do in any software, whether or not it has a ludicrously long test-and-deploy cycle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18463075).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-12-01..2018-12-31),
we landed ___ PRs in the bors-ng repository.
