It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a GitHub App for automated testing
[by branching from master, and rerunning tests before the final merge, like you should do in any software, whether or not it has a ludicrously long test-and-deploy cycle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18463075).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-12-01..2018-12-31),
we landed 9 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [how\_is](https://github.com/how-is/how_is), an app that gathers metrics for your GitHub repository. [Here's a report for bors-ng](https://bors.tech/newsletter/2019/01/01/tmib-24/report.html), and [here's one for how\_is itself](https://how-is.github.io/manual-reports/how_is/2017/07/02/report.html), for example. It's similar to GitHub's "Insights", but it has a few reports that GitHub doesn't, and it can generate reports retroactively.

Got any suggestions for next month?
