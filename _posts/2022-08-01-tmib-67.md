It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a [limited solution](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/2798) for merge enforcement.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2022-07-01..2022-07-31),
we landed 9 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [mailu](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu), a self-hostable email server package. It combines several servers, like dovecot (a MDA), postfix (a MTA), and a few other things like rspamd and your choice of MUA. The advantage of using Mailu is that you don't need to know what [those acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_agent_(infrastructure)) mean or what the difference is between those services: you just deploy the complete, already-integrated suite of Docker containers, and connect to it using webmail or your choice of desktop email client.

Got any suggestions for next month?
Post a comment on the [August pull request](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng.github.io/pull/177).
