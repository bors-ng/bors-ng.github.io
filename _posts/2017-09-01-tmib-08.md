It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
the GitHub App that enforces the rule that a project should
[automatically maintain a line of code that always passes all the tests](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-08-01..2017-08-31),
we landed __ PRs in the bors-ng repository.
