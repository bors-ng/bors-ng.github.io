It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
the GitHub App that enforces the rule that a project should
[automatically maintain a line of code that always passes all the tests](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-08-01..2017-08-31),
we landed __ PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [IntelliJ-Rust], language support for the Rust programming language in JetBrains' IDE.

* The plugin is written in [Kotlin], the same language that large parts of IntelliJ-IDEA is, not Rust.
* The plugin implements its own parser and typechecker, basically a rewrite of large parts of the Rust compiler.
* It integrates with Rust tooling and conventions; it can pull out doc comments, it understands macros like `println!`, and it understands Cargo projects and dependencies.

In the Good-Cheap-Performant triangle, IntelliJ-Rust intends to be Good and Performant more than Cheap.
