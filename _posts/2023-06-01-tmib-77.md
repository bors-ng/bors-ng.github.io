It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, the old, deprecated, third-party [workflow automation bot](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_rust/issues/99) for GitHub.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2023-05-01..2023-05-31),
we landed 7 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!
