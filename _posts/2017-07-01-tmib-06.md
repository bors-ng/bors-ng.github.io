### Who's using bors?

[nix-rust/nix], not to be confused with the package manager called Nix, is a Rust library that provides memory-safe bindings to OS facilities that are specific to UNIX-like OS's (like macOS and Linux), without imposing runtime overhead on top of the libc-provided interface.

Their Travis CI build matrix [has 18 configurations and has a total time around an hour][example travis build]: Linux on several different architectures, Mac OS X ("darwin"), and smoke tests for cross-compiling from Linux to FreeBSD and NetBSD. A Nix developer also runs [an instance of BuildBot][example buildbot build], which they use to actually run the test suite on FreeBSD. You can see how they configure bors-ng to work with this in their [bors.toml] file.
