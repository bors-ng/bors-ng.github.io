### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [TiTun](https://github.com/sopium/titun), an experimental userspace implementation of the WireGuard protocol. It has (at least partial) support for Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Wireguard is a performance-oriented VPN protocol, providing an IP tunnel with less complex setup than protocols like IPSec.
