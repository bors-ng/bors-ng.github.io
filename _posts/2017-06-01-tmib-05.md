It's another monthly burst of news about bors,
the bot that tests your code before it becomes the master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-05-01..2017-05-31),
we landed 12 PRs in the bors-ng repository.


### Notable Additions

* notriddle [switched](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/172) to using the GitHub App login flow, instead of a separate OAuth App
* mmun [configured](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/183) bors to infer CircleCI configuration, in the absence of a bors.toml file
* notriddle [made](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/184) bors error out if it's configured to block on nothing
* notriddle [started](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/188) bors testing with MySQL as well as PostgreSQL
* jniles [updated](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/195) the README to identify bors as a GitHub App
* notriddle [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/192) the add-reviewer flow in some cases
* notriddle [cleaned](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/182) [up](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/181) the Heroku setup instructions

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint). Pint is a Python package for dimensional analysis, doing arithmetic on numbers with units (like mass in kilograms, length in astronomical units, and volume in pints).

  * Your arithmetic can be written in natural-looking Python, since Pint overrides the mathematical operators.

    ```python
    >>> import pint
    >>> ureg = pint.UnitRegistry()
    >>> 3 * ureg.meter + 4 * ureg.cm
    <Quantity(3.04, 'meter')>
    ```

  * Pint has [built-in support for asserting dimension types](http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.2/wrapping.html), so that unit errors cause the program to crash instead of giving meaningless results:
  
    ```python
    >>> import pint
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> ureg = pint.UnitRegistry()
    >>> G = ureg("9.8 m s^-2")
    >>> @ureg.check('[length]')
    ... def pendulum_period(length):
    ...     return 2*np.pi*np.sqrt(length/G)
    ...
    >>> pendulum_period(5 * ureg.seconds)
    pint.errors.DimensionalityError: Cannot convert from '5 second' ([time]) to 'a quantity of' ([length])
    >>> pendulum_period(5 * ureg.meters)
    <Quantity(4.48798950513, 'second')>
    ```

  * Also, Pint supports NumPy without wrapping or monkey-patching it.
