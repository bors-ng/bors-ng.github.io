It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng:

>  * A continuous integration bot.
>  * Awaits reviewer approval on PRs, builds them as though they were merged, only merges on green.
>  * Updates PR with merge status.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Fusion Dealership Systems](https://github.com/fusionapp), who write software used by car dealerships out of South Africa. They've open sourced pretty much everything they develop that isn't directly related to selling cars, like their [search indexing microservice](https://github.com/fusionapp/fusion-index), [blob store microservice](https://github.com/fusionapp/entropy), and many [upstream contributions](https://github.com/twisted/txacme) to [Twisted Python](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commits?author=mithrandi).

One of their employees, [mithrandi](https://github.com/mithrandi), helped us get a good, official Docker image for bors-ng [that works in the same infrastructure](https://gitter.im/bors-ng/Lobby?at=5a16c073540c78242d3c8433) that they run all their other stuff in. Thanks for being an early adopter and helping find all the kinks in our deploy story, Fusion!
