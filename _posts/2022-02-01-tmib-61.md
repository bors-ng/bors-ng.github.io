It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a third-party merge queue implementation for GitHub.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2022-01-01..2022-01-31),
we landed 17 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [salsa-rs], "a generic framework for on-demand, incrementalized computation." It's a framework, in the [inversion of control] sense, where you structure your program as a set of pure functional queries that the framework will execute as-needed and [memoize]. It's great if your program looks like some sort of database, like rust-analyzer, which [uses it][rust-analyzer cargo file], because it means you can:

* Use multiple threads without having to do the synchronization yourself, because the framework will "just run more than one query at once."
* Recompute parts of your derived data when one thing changes, without having to recompute everything from scratch (what they call "incrementalized").
* Avoid computing data that is not actually used (what they call "on-demand").

They have not only API docs, but also a very incomplete [handbook](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/), for getting started.
