It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [a CI service](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6703) that helps you enforce the "never break the build" policy in your GitHub repositories.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-11-01..2018-11-30),
we landed ___ PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.

* alsuren [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/544) a bunch of compiler warnings

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Amethyst](https://www.amethyst.rs/), a data-oriented game engine. It's massively multithreaded, memory safe, and based on an [Entity—Component—System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) architecture to achieve good cache locality and separation of concerns.

Amethyst uses bors with their thirty-eight thousand line-of-[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)-code monorepo. Bors is also used by many of Amethyst's dependencies, such as [gfx](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx), [specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs), and [ron](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron). All of them support Windows, Linux, and Mac, and have been adding support for more (such as [iOS](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/blob/3165d55/.travis.yml#L30-L34)).
