It's another monthly burst of news about bors,
the bot that tests your code before it becomes the master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-04-01..2017-04-30),
we landed 17 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

* notriddle [enabled](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/144) wobserver on Heroku
* Macarse [fixed](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/145) some mistakes in the developer documentation
* notriddle [added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/143) docker-based setup scripts to start a local instance on new contributor's machines

* Macarse [added](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/147) Credo, and fixed some warnings that it produced
* notriddle [set](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/167) the webhook controller to silently ignore actions that it does not care about
