### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is the [Mozilla Product Delivery Team](https://github.com/mozilla/product-delivery). They build tools to deliver changes to Firefox in-between full releases. They've integrated bors into the workflow for several of their projects, and have [integrated it into some of their tools](https://github.com/peterbe/whatsdeployed/pull/35). Among other projects, they maintain:

* [Normandy](https://github.com/mozilla/normandy), which serves instructions on changes to make in the form of signed and verified "recipes"
* [Buildhub](https://github.com/mozilla/buildhub2), the service that indexes all Firefox builds
* [Delivery Console](https://github.com/mozilla/delivery-console), an admin panel for Normandy (and other backends in the future)
* Mozilla's [distribution](https://github.com/mozilla-services/kinto-dist) of [kinto](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto)
* [Remote Settings](https://github.com/mozilla/remote-settings) a way to manage evergreen data such as add-on block lists in Firefox
