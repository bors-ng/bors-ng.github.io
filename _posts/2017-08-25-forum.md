There's a real, official place to ask questions now.
It's at [forum.bors.tech].
You can log in with your GitHub account, just like you log into bors itself.

## A little information about Discourse

If you've used [elixirforum.com] or [users.rust-lang.org], you've already used Discourse.
Have fun!

If not, you might still notice some similarities with GitHub issues.
There are obvious similarities, such as:

* they both use Markdown syntax for posts
* they both have primarily linear discussion
* they both default to showing you a list of recently-updated items
* they both use `@mention`-style

Also, the bors-ng forum has reply-by-email turned on,
so you can reply to someone else's post right in your mail client.
Discourse tops it off with a specialized "mailing list mode" (accessible in your user settings)
and registered users can create new topics by emailing the right address (such as <user-support@forum.bors.tech>).

## What about the other ones?

IRC shouldn't be the preferred place to discuss bors-ng any more.
Unless there's a strong outcry, it's going to be deprecated and shut down.

[Gitter] is going to continue as the alternative to Discourse,
for when staying to one topic is not going to work right.
Sticking to a topic might not always seem like the right way to have a discussion,
and that's probably the way that chat works best.
Gitter is easier for existing GitHub users to set up than IRC,
so it's the one that wins out.
