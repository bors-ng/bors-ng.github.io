There's a real, official place to ask questions now.
It's at [forum.bors.tech](https://forum.bors.tech).
You can log in with your GitHub account, just like you log into bors itself.

## A little information about Discourse

If you've used [elixirforum.com] or [users.rust-lang.org], you've already used Discourse.
Have fun!

If not, you might still notice some similarity with GitHub issues.
There are obvious similarities, such as:

* they both use Markdown syntax for posts
* they both have primarily linear discussion
* they both default to showing you a list of recently-updated items
* they both use `@mention`-style

Also, the bors-ng forum has reply-by-email turned on,
so you can reply to someone else's post right in your mail client.
Discourse tops it off with a specialized "mailing list mode" (accessible in your user settings)
and registered users can create new topics by emailing the right address (such as <user-support@forum.bors.tech>).

## What about the other ones?

IRC shouldn't be the preferred place to discuss bors-ng any more.
Unless there's a strong outcry, it's going to be deprecated and shut down.

[Gitter] is going to continue as an alternative to Discourse,
for when staying to one topic is not going to work right.
Sticking to a topic is probably the best way to answer people's questions,
but for generating ideas it's probably too limiting.
