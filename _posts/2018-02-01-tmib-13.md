It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
GitHub's missing [merge-on-green button](https://twitter.com/sgrif/status/936448446566866945).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-01-01..2018-01-31),
we landed 12 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.
If you find a mistake, [pull requests] or [issue reports] are appreciated!
