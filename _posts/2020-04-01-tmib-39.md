It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [another piece of boilerplate crap for your GitHub repository](https://twitter.com/stdlib/status/1226242263178776578).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2020-03-01..2020-03-31),
we landed 15 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
