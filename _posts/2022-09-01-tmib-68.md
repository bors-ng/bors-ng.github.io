### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops), the pure functional configuration management system. NixOps, and its parent project NixOS, develops tooling for UNIX-like operating systems (mostly Linux and macOS) to cleanly separate the configuration of a system from its runtime state so that you can easily reproduce it.
