It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng,
a CI approach that merges in changes *after* they're tested instead of before.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-12-01..2017-12-31),
we landed xxxxxxx PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written in public on GitHub.
