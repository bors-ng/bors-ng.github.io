### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [therapist](https://github.com/rehandalal/therapist), a lint suite runner.
Therapist is a tool to help create robust, easily-configurable pre-commit hooks for Git.
It has an easy command to install its pre-commit hook, and a config file that actually gets checked into your repo,
to ensure that everyone who contributes to your project runs the same set of checks.
This allows you to find and fix common issues before you actually commit code to your repo.
