### Who's using bors?

This monthâ€™s featured user is gfx-rs, a low-level graphics abstraction library in Rust.
* It aims to be the choice of cross-platform graphics development, serve as a basis for GPUWeb implementation, and provide the external C API for Vulkan portability initiative. See "[We need to go lower](http://gfx-rs.github.io/2017/07/24/low-level.html)" for more info.
* The project has seen intensive development last month with over 50 merged pull requests having 130+ commits touching several thousand lines of code.
* Main forces are concentrated around shaping up the low-level core API. The library structure has been shaken up, and a new vision is slowly materializing.
