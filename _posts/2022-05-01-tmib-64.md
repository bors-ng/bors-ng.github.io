It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng. It has [no relation](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/425#issuecomment-695806420) with any of the graydon, barosl, servo, or rust-lang bors's in any way, but still implements the same basic idea.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2022-04-01..2022-04-30),
we landed 3 PRs in the bors-ng repository.
