It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a [merge queue for hunting down bugs before they are merged into master](https://nmattia.com/posts/2019-01-08-hunt-bugs-down-before-they-are-merged.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2019-01-01..2019-01-31), we landed 12 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB]. If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is Daedalus of Freedom, an online role-playing game built on the [BYOND](https://secure.byond.com/) (Build Your Own Net Dream) engine. [Here's their getting started guide for new players](https://dofgaming.us/wiki/Guide_for_New_Players) and [here's their source code](https://github.com/TheDaedalusCrew/Daedalus-of-Freedom).

But if you're into bors, then you're probably most interested in the [test system](https://github.com/TheDaedalusCrew/Daedalus-of-Freedom/blob/master/test/run-test.sh). TheDaedalusCrew/Daedalus-of-Freedom has a couple of different codebases that they test in the same repo:

* The tgui and nano directories are frontend JavaScript code for custom screens. It is tested within Node.JS.
* The "code" directory is the "game world" definition, written in BYOND's domain-specific language. They even have their own unit testing system!
* They also run a number of lints, found [here](https://github.com/TheDaedalusCrew/Daedalus-of-Freedom/blob/master/test/run-test.sh#L197-L215), on their BYOND, HTML, and CSS code. Some of which is as simple as "this function is banned, so grep for it."

Got any suggestions for next month?
