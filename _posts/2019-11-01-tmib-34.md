### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [Rust `parking_lot`](https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot).

The "parking lot" is a synchonization architecture for multithreaded applications. It was [designed by the WebKit team](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/), and turned into a reusable Rust library. It is typically faster and more space efficient than the locks provided by POSIX and Win32, since it doesn't need to maintain backwards compatibility with them, and it uses [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350/webkit) instead of a guaranteed FIFO.

Got any suggestions for next month?
