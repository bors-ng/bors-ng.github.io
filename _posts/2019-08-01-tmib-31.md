It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a buggy, poorly-documented reimplementation of about half of [Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2019-07-01..2019-07-31),
we landed 38 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is Tink, an API service provider for banking in Europe. By connecting to Tink, you can use their API to perform money transfers between banks, to look up a person's financial information across all of their banks, and to collect aggregate data across the financial sector. Here's their story:

> We at Tink (http://www.tink.com) are using Bors heavily in essentially all our private (and a couple of public, I think) repositories. We've been using it since the beginning of 2018 and have been really happy with it! @umamaistempo, who contributed a bunch of pull requests last month, is a colleague of mine. ⭐️ For all repositories, bors has made sure that our developer can focus on shipping, not waiting for the Github PR merge button to turn green. It also makes sure we can't break master. While these are nice features for smaller repositories the benefit of this is immense for our larger repositories with >75 active contributors. It's also for larger repositories where batching of multiple pull requests really shine.
>
> To be able to run Bors for private repositories we had to set up a private instance of it. It wasn't too much work and it's been running stable since then. So far we haven't had any issues with the few times (maybe ~10 times) we've upgrade it.
>
> Ever since we started using bors questions, issues and pull requests have all received very quick responses and we've been very happy with the community activity. Unfortunately we haven't had any Elixir developers until @umamaistempo joined us, so before that we tried to contribute by submitting issues and submitting bug reports and get engaged that way.

Got any suggestions for next month?
