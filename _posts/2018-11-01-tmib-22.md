It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng. [It's designed to support the workflow that projects like Rust and Servo use: you tell the bot that a PR is good to merge, and then it takes over and manages the CI process so as to guarantee that the head of the master branch has always passed all its tests (the "not rocket science rule")](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-January/151921.html).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2018-10-01..2018-10-31),
we landed 24 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [pathfinding](https://github.com/samueltardieu/pathfinding): a graph-analysis library for Rust. Pathfinding provides algorithms for matching, exploring, and finding optimal paths and flows through graphs. It's also generic, so you can use it with any backing store.
