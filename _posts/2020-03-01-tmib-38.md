### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer), an experimental compiler frontend for the [Rust language](https://rust-lang.org).

The [compiler frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Front_end) performs all of the language-specific work before code generation itself (primarily, this means parsing the code, building a symbol table, and checking types). The Rust Analyzer is specifically designed for [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) use, so it acts as a testing ground for analyzing syntactically ill-formed programs, incremental analysis, and performance optimizations within the compiler.
